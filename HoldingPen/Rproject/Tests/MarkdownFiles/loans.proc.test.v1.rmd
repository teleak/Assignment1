R loans markdown tests
========================================================
#### Load required libraries
```{r, libraries,results='hide', message=FALSE}
require(plyr)
require(Hmisc)
require(lattice)
require(RColorBrewer)
require(hexbin)
```

### read in preprocessed data 
```{r}
loans<-read.csv( '~/Desktop/RCourse/DataAnalysis/AnalysisAssignment1/Rproject/ProcessedData/Working/loans.csv')
data<-read.csv('~/Desktop/RCourse/DataAnalysis/AnalysisAssignment1/Rproject/ProcessedData/Working/data.csv')
```

### dimensions of data
```{r}
dim(loans)
dim(data)
```
### Describe loans -- noticed that summary doesn't show loan amount of -0.01 in two rows. 
```{r}
summary(loans)
range(loans$loaned)
subset(loans, loaned == -0.01)
```

### dropping rows from loaned that show loan amount < 0 (assuming this must be error)
```{r}
min(loans$loaned)
loans<-loans[loans$loaned >= 0,]
min(loans$loaned)
```

### Break income down into ranges
```{r}
attach(loans)
	range(income)
	inc.low<-floor(min(income))
	inc.high<-ceiling(max(income))
######## add  log income 2 as factor 
	log.income<-log2(loans$income)
 	l.inc.low<-min(log.income) ### min of log income
	l.inc.high<-max(log.income)
	income.groups2<-cut2(log.income, seq(l.inc.low, l.inc.high, by=1))
	loans$log2.inc.range<-as.factor(income.groups2)
	head(loans)
### income to debt range as factor
	head(loans)
	range(debts)
	debt.range<-cut2(debts, seq(min(debts), max(debts), by=5))
	loans$debt.range<-as.factor(debt.range)
	table(debt.range)
### sample loans
	set.seed(1234)
	nrow(loans)
	train.indicator<-rbinom(nrow(loans), size=1, prob=0.5)
	table(train.indicator)
	loans$train.indicator<-as.factor(train.indicator)
	training.loans<-loans[train.indicator ==1, ]
detach(loans)
```

### Some exploratory
```{r}
attach(loans)
	hist(loaned, breaks=100
		,main="Amount Loaned"
		,col="orange")
	hist(log10(requested))
	plot(loaned~log10(income))
	boxplot(loaned ~ income) ### not very informative
	histogram(~loaned | log2.inc.range,
			main="Loan amount by Log(2) Income Range")
	histogram(~loaned | debt.range,
			main="Loan amount by Debt to Income Ratio")
	req.int<-hexbin(requested, interest)
	plot(req.int)
	plot(requested, loaned, cex=(income/1000)*.2)
### lets try a bubble chart
	symbols(requested, loaned, circles=income/500)
	## size circles area=pi*r^2, r=root(pi*r^2)
	radius <- sqrt(income/pi)
	symbols(requested, loaned, 
		   circles=radius, 
		   inches=0.2,
		   fg="white",
		   bg=(col=log2.inc.range)
		   )
detach(loans)
### too busy sample (above) and try with debts as a factor
attach(training.loans)
	symbols(requested, debts, circles=income/500)
	## size circles area=pi*r^2, r=root(pi*r^2)
	radius <- sqrt(income/pi)
	symbols(requested, debts, 
		   circles=radius, 
		   inches=0.2,
		   fg="white",
		   bg=(col=log2.inc.range)
		   )
detach(training.loans)
```
